                        <p>Our 2021-22 plane was named Lazarus. Its main features were six ramps which allowed it to deploy packages carefully through the sides of the fuselage. The plane had to be rebuilt overnight at competition after an unfortunate accident. It still earned 16th place overall!  </p>

                        <p>Our 2020-21 plane was given the name Patchwork due to the piece-by-piece manner in which the plane was built by members in a number of different locations. The central design goal was to create a plane capable of stowing, deploying, towing, and retracting a sensor with flashing lights visible in daylight. </p>

                        <p>Our 2019-20 final competition plane was to be named Spruce Zeus, but only two planes were built before competition was canceled. The palne was designed to carry as many passengers and luggage as possible for mission 2 and to be able to deploy, tow, and stow a banner with the UCLA logo on it. </p>
