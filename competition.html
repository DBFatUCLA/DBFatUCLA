          <h2>The Missions</h2>
          <p>Each year, the DBF competition rules set three flight missions and one ground mission. Each mission has its own criteria on how to earn points; we build a plane to maximize the total points over all missions. This year, the missions are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mission 1: Aircraft Delivery - The mission is to demonstrate the aircraft's ability to fly three laps in under five minutes, without a payload.</li>
            <li>Mission 2: Medical Transportation - The mission is to fly three laps as quickly as possible, while carrying a payload of wooden peg dolls symbolizing the crew, patient on a gurney, and a medical supply cabinet.</li>
            <li>Mission 3: Urban Taxiing - The mission is to fly as many laps as possible in five minutes, while carrying a payload of wooden peg dolls symbolizing passengers.</li>
            <li>Ground Mission: Configuration Demonstration - The mission is to transition between parking configuration and the flight configurations, with the M2 and M3 payloads, as fast as possible.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Logistics</h2>
          <p>Competition will take place in Wichita, Kansas from April 18 to 21 2024. Join us to be part of this wonderful experience! </p>
